# TrackSpace

Front-end prototypes for the TrackSphere asset management experience.

## Project layout

```
assets/           # Shared images and placeholders
flex/             # Flexbox-first implementation of each page (home, about, dashboard, ...)
grid/             # CSS Grid implementation of the same screens
```

Each HTML file is named after the page it represents (for example `dashboard.html`,
`about.html`, `login.html`) to keep navigation paths consistent across both layout
approaches.
